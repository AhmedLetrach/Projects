# Project Overview

## Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor

The **Gold Price Prediction** project utilizes a **Random Forest Regressor**, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to forecast gold prices based on historical data and relevant features. By training the model on comprehensive datasets, we aim to develop an accurate predictive model that can provide valuable insights to investors and stakeholders in the precious metals market.

### Project Objectives:

- Develop and implement a Random Forest Regressor model for gold price prediction.
- Preprocess and analyze historical gold price data to identify significant features.
- Optimize the model to achieve the highest prediction accuracy possible.
- Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune parameters to enhance predictions.

## Sentiment Analysis in Python using VADER and Pre-trained Roberta Model

The **Sentiment Analysis** project employs the **VADER** sentiment analysis tool, combined with a bag-of-words approach and a pre-trained **RoBERTa** model from Hugging Face. This project explores and compares results between the two approaches, utilizing NLTK for natural language processing and Transformers for sentiment inference.

### Project Objectives:

- Perform sentiment analysis using VADER and a bag-of-words approach.
- Utilize a pre-trained RoBERTa model for sentiment analysis and compare results.
- Explore the strengths and weaknesses of each approach for sentiment analysis.
